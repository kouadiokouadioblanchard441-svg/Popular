name: TGOOD customer service hours
description: Customer-support availability is derived from the configured service-hour window.

The customer-service screen uses the configured start and end hours to show the current online/offline state and refreshes it every minute. Configured support links remain clickable even when the displayed status is offline.

**Why:** The owner requires the support buttons to keep working outside service hours while still showing the configured offline status.

**How to apply:** Keep the displayed hours and online/offline calculation driven by the same settings. Preserve overnight-window handling, but do not gate configured support-link activation on that status.
